The construction of the Flavian Amphitheater, better known as the Roman Coliseum, began around AD 7 under the Emperor Vespasian. The Coliseum was built in a valley, having dried a small lake that Nero used for the Domus Aurea, between the hills of the Palatine, Esquiline and Celio. The Emperor Titus inaugurated the Colosseum in the year 80, but 2 years later finished the works that included the last floor.

The Colosseum became the largest Roman amphitheater, with an elliptical structure of 188 meters long, 156 meters wide and 57 meters high. Made in brick and covered with travertine was divided into five levels with a capacity for more than 50,000 people. Its areas were delimited depending on the social class, the closer to the arena they were the greater the rank to which they belonged.

In the nineteenth century, work was done on the settlement and remodeling of the Coliseum, and although during World War II suffered the effects of the attacks, this majestic and imposing monument has become a cultural asset of the city and the world surviving the time and wars.
